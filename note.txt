SQLAlchemy queries and more.

- a lot of useful output from writing tests with very little boilerplate.
- 'Pytest-cov' is an add-on that gives you a read-out of your test coverage.

flake8 []
- analyze your code base for styling consistency and mistakes
- essential for open source projects because it keeps everyone on the same page for style guides

Flask-SQLAlchemy & psycopg2 []
- psycopg2 lets Python communicate with PostgreSQL
- Flask-SQLALchemy uses SQLAlchemy under the hood to provide you an ORM(Object-relational mapping).
- SQLAlchemy is flexible enough to where you can write raw SQL

alembic []

celery & redis []
- to execute background jobs, managing jobs & running off tasks or scheduled tasks
- Redis is just a key / value store that you can use to back your Celery jobs

Flask-WTF & WTForms-Components []
- set up things like which fields belong to which form, set up validation rules
and additional logic related to processing a form
- WTForms-Components is just an add-on that provides a few common field types, validations
and widgets that don’t come with WTForms by default
-Some of these include TimeField, SelectMultipleField and being able to do a database backed Uniqueness check on a field

Flask-Login [Y]
- free reign to create a user flow that works best for your application,
but it takes care of the scary parts of authentication such as session management and dealing with cookies

Flask-limiter []
- controlling traffic rates. You can do rate limiting by IP address or other rules
- (e.g.) “Only let users visit this page once per minute, but let admins always visit it”
- could be used to protect API endpoints as well
- use together with Redis as a back-end to store the rate limit information so lookups and writes are lightning fast

Flask-Mail [Y]
- Flask-Mail handles sending SMTP based email.
- has a debug mode which lets you test sending emails without actually sending them out. It also deals with attachments too
